# React Static Boilerplate

> **React Static Boilerplate** is a repo for creating React based stand alone websites
> (sites that are served as static html, css, and javascript). The repo doesn't include any server, it
> needs to be built and deployed to a static page web server.

### Features

- Modern JavaScript syntax ([ES2015](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/)+) via [Babel](http://babeljs.io/)
- Component-based UI architecture via [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- Application state management via [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
- Hot Module Replacement ([HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html)) /w [React Hot Loader](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/)<br>

```


### Getting Started

**Step 1**. Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6 or newer installed on your
machine.

**Step 2**. Clone this repository or use [Yeoman
generator](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate/tree/generator-react-static) to
bootstrap your project:

```shell
$ git clone -o react-static-boilerplate -b master --single-branch \
      https://github.com/kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
$ npm install                   # Install project dependencies listed in package.json
```

<p align="center">——— or ———</p>

```shell
$ npm install -g yo
$ npm install -g generator-react-static
$ mkdir MyApp
$ cd MyApp
$ yo react-static
```

**Step 3**. Compile and launch your app by running:

```shell
$ node run                      # Same as `npm start` or `node run start`
```

You can also test your app in release (production) mode by running `node run start --release` or
with HMR and React Hot Loader disabled by running `node run start --no-hmr`. The app should become
available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).


### How to Test

The unit tests are powered by [chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [mocha](http://mochajs.org/).

```shell
$ npm run lint                  # Check JavaScript and CSS code for potential issues
$ npm run test                  # Run unit tests. Or, `npm run test:watch`
```


### How to Deploy

Update `publish` script in the [`run.js`](run.js) file with your full Firebase project name as found
in your [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Note that this may have an
additional identifier suffix than the shorter name you've provided. Then run: 

```shell
$ node run publish              # Build and publish the website to Firebase, same as `npm run publish`
```

The first time you publish, you will be prompted to authenticate with Google and generate an
authentication token in order for the publish script to continue.

If you need just to build the project without publishing it, run:

```shell
$ node run build                # Or, `node run build --release` for production build
```


### How to Update

You can always fetch and merge the recent changes from this repo back into your own project:

```shell
$ git checkout master
$ git fetch react-static-boilerplate
$ git merge react-static-boilerplate/master
$ npm install
```
