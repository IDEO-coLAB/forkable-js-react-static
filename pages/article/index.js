            PORTLAND, OR—Pointing out that the total dipshit had dropped dozens
            of acorns all along the length of pavement, sources confirmed Thursday
            that a completely idiotic tree keeps trying to plant seeds on the sidewalk.
            “Come on, you fucking moron, what are you doing? That’s concrete,” said local
            pedestrian Frank Brogden, who shook his head while pondering why the
            dumbshit California black oak was stupid enough to believe its saplings
            could grow in an area devoid of soil, nutrients, and water. “Oh, yeah,
            I can’t wait to see the tree sprouting right up in the middle of 5-inch-thick cement.
             The dirt’s that way, Einstein.” At press time, Brogden was reportedly overheard
             muttering “What the fuck?” under his breath as the tree attempted to plant
             a seed on a parked car.
